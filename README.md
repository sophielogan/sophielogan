ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophie


I use data to work on climate justice issues. 

An example of a data science project about [premature mortalitity due to air pollution in the Balkans](https://github.com/sophielogan/sophielogan/blob/main/Pollution_in_the_Balkans.pdf)

An example [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/SYRSZNC3R?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y) about Environmental, Social, and Governance pledges of Public Corporations 

You can find my articles & publications here: 
- I contributed to Climate Tech VC's newsletter regarding [climate risk within investments](https://www.ctvc.co/climate-risk-is-investment-risk/)
- I also wrote about [voluntary ESG disclosure](https://www.metric-esg.com/esgblog/from-voluntary-to-mandatory-esg-disclosure) and how it is changing (or not) with new regulation, which was related to a dashboard I built highlighting companies' ESG commitments by geography and sector 
- While at Morningstar I published various articles ([here](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/997270/a-checklist-for-social-good-closing-the-intention-action-gap-when-giving-back) and [here](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/987972/what-can-you-do-to-support-under-represented-people-in-finance))
