👋 Hi, I’m Sophie


I use data to work on climate equity issues. 

I run the 🗞️ [data journalism efforts](https://esgdata.worldbank.org/explore/stories?lang=en) for the Sovereign ESG Data Portal at the World Bank

Here is an example of a data science project (comparing SVD and LSTM for time-series data) about ☁️ [premature mortalitity due to air pollution in the Balkans](https://github.com/sophielogan/sophielogan/blob/main/Pollution_in_the_Balkans.pdf) and using 📚 [natural language processing to summarize climate texts](https://github.com/sophielogan/Climate_Texts_Summarization?search=1).

Here is an example 🖥️ [dashboard in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/shared/SYRSZNC3R?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y) about Environmental, Social, and Governance pledges of Public Corporations.  

You can find my articles & publications here: 
- I contributed to Climate Tech VC's newsletter regarding [climate risk within investments](https://www.ctvc.co/climate-risk-is-investment-risk/)
- I collaborated on work around how [peer benchmarking can help countries set and reach SDG targets](https://esgdata.worldbank.org/explore/stories?lang=en)
- I also wrote about [voluntary ESG disclosure](https://www.metric-esg.com/esgblog/from-voluntary-to-mandatory-esg-disclosure) and how it is changing (or not) with new regulation, which was related to a dashboard I built highlighting companies' ESG commitments by geography and sector 
- While at Morningstar I published various articles ([here](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/997270/a-checklist-for-social-good-closing-the-intention-action-gap-when-giving-back) and [here](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/987972/what-can-you-do-to-support-under-represented-people-in-finance))
